						<h2 class="agentName agentElement">Bob Nasiatka</h2>
						<p class="agentParagraph agentElement">Being a realtor for eleven years has allowed me to pair my knowledge with my passion. I have bought and sold my own investment properties since 1997, eventually expanding that endeavor into managing other client’s properties as well. The culmination of that hard work was the establishment of my property management company, R&R Realty, in 2005.</br></br>Complementing my years of experience, I work hard to stay on real estate’s cutting edge by using the latest industry technology. This allows me to equip both my buyers and sellers with the most up to date information. As a life-long Rhode Island resident, I also have a unique perspective on current trends in the Southeastern New England markets. Clients choose to work with me for my years of experience, ethics and commitment to service. My business is 90% referral and 10% new business which I proudly believe speaks volumes about my client’s satisfaction.</p>

						<h3 class="agentName agentElement">Rick Delmastro</h3>
						<p class="agentParagraph agentElement">As a relatively new Real Estate Sales Associate of about 1 year, I have gained invaluable knowledge and experience through my affiliation with August Associates, LLC. My personal reason for becoming involved in the Real Estate industry was my interests in business (have owned my own for almost 30 years), investments, and most importantly my desire to assist you, the client, in the sometimes arduous task of buying or selling a home. As a youth football, baseball and lacrosse coach over the past 14 years, I have developed great lasting relationships with players and parents alike, who have appreciated my genuine help-driven style. My main focus is to protect the interests of the client, and I strive to make their experience as pleasurable as possible. I am proud to be a member of this excellent “team”.</p>

					<h3 class="agentName agentElement">Joseph McCarthy</h3>
					<p class="agentParagraph agentElement">Joseph McCarthy is the Founder and Principal Broker of August Associates LLC, Your Valued Guide In Real Estate. He is dedicated to providing outstanding service and knowledge in real estate with over 20 years of experience working for a corporate concern as a Sales Associate and later a Broker Associate.<br/><br/>He maintains a broad practice by representing a full range of clients from first-time homebuyers to second-time home buyers.<br/><br/>The City of Providence, professional companies, and community developers in the non-profit sector have procured his representation to protect and guide their interest.<br/><br/>In 2000, Joseph sat on a house summit panel and began to speak about the lack of education available to the consumer. His stand to this important issue, led him on a crusade of partnering up with local non-profits and eventually becoming a teacher for home buyer education. He didn't stop there. Joseph became active in his local board, Greater Providence Board of Realtors, and became Secretary on the State Association in 2011. He has spoken out on issues that affect real estate and was instrumental in obtaining the tax adjustment on transfer of property in Providence. That earned him recognitions from his peers and numerous awards and nominations including Realtor of the Year.<br/><br/>Joseph continues to broaden his skills as a real estate professional through education not only being the teacher but the pupil. He quotes, "I find that at teaching, I learn more from others than I do teaching." When asked what do you do for pleasure he responded, "Cooking creations. Food innovations inspired by his day". He adds, "It's all about keeping it natural, simple, clean and tasty." As an old friend would say, "The difference between a great chef and a good chef is a pinch of salt."</p>

					<h3 class="agentName agentElement">Bob Nasiatka</h3>
					<p class="agentParagraph agentElement">Being a realtor for eleven years has allowed me to pair my knowledge with my passion. I have bought and sold my own investment properties since 1997, eventually expanding that endeavor into managing other client’s properties as well. The culmination of that hard work was the establishment of my property management company, R&R Realty, in 2005.<br/><br/>Complementing my years of experience, I work hard to stay on real estate’s cutting edge by using the latest industry technology. This allows me to equip both my buyers and sellers with the most up to date information. As a life-long Rhode Island resident, I also have a unique perspective on current trends in the Southeastern New England markets. Clients choose to work with me for my years of experience, ethics and commitment to service. My business is 90% referral and 10% new business which I proudly believe speaks volumes about my client’s satisfaction.</p>

					<h3 class="agentName agentElement">Rick Delmastro</h3>
					<p class="agentParagraph agentElement">As a relatively new Real Estate Sales Associate of about 1 year, I have gained invaluable knowledge and experience through my affiliation with August Associates, LLC. My personal reason for becoming involved in the Real Estate industry was my interests in business (have owned my own for almost 30 years), investments, and most importantly my desire to assist you, the client, in the sometimes arduous task of buying or selling a home. As a youth football, baseball and lacrosse coach over the past 14 years, I have developed great lasting relationships with players and parents alike, who have appreciated my genuine help-driven style. My main focus is to protect the interests of the client, and I strive to make their experience as pleasurable as possible. I am proud to be a member of this excellent “team”.</p>

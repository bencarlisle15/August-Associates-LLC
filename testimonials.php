						<p class="testimonialText">We met Joseph last year (2016) when we were searching for our dream house. It had been a 2.5+ year process and had had a big disappointment earlier that year, which left us quite gun-shy. We immediately felt at ease with him while he showed us several properties that we were interested in. His years of experience and expertise gave us sound feedback at each property and through this process, he quickly assessed what we were looking for in a home. His input was invaluable. After several months of looking, we found a home which he helped broker for us. Joseph's ability to stay calm when dealing with difficult personalities proved to be our anchor when dealing with several people in our search and final decision. His professionalism is top notch and we would highly recommend him to anyone looking for a home. His ethics are exemplary and his knowledge of the real estate market is outstanding. We sincerely appreciate what he brokered for us and are happily settled in our forever home.</p>

						<p class="testimonialText">My experience with Joseph was extremely positive. I got two offers within two days of being on the market, and I was willing to accept a number---in CASH--that I was comfortable with. I wanted expediency, but Joe told me to give him a few days and he'd get me a bit more. I agreed, and he did get me more.</br>After meeting with several real estate people, I knew immediately that Joe would handle my sale. Although he deploys modern day statistical analysis, he's  got an old school streak in him as well---he can read people, and understands what buyers and sellers want, need, and will accept. Like a good baseball manager, he uses a mix of new school Sabermetrics and time-honored people skills to get the desired result. And he SHOULD know what he's doing---he's been at it in RI forever. I would highly recommend him, and if I ever were to do any more RE transactions, he'd be my first choice.</p>

						<p class="testimonialText">Joe and I have worked together for over 10 years and he has assisted with the purchase and sale of over two dozen investment properties. As a REALTOR, Joe is a great resource because he understands the nuances of home financing and uses all avenues of available funding. He has worked through difficult transactions with ease which resulted in great success for both buyer and seller! I highly recommend Joe!</p>

						<p class="testimonialText">Joe is the most knowledeable realtor in the business. He knows construction and building code law. He has my back. He has put my interests above making a commission more than once. Simply said, I trust Joe above anyone in the business and I give my permission to use any or all of my statement in any ad.
